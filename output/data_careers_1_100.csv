The program offers electives for the students to enhance the knowledge of emerging machines$ areas of power electronics applications and techniques to optimize the designs. The Program culminates with a project work in which the students are encouraged to work on specific areas involving design$ simulation$ fabrication and testing of any power electronics system having research/industrial application values. >< Course Name : M. TECH VLSI DESIGN # Eligibility : Pass with Minimum 60% in B. E./B. Tech./M.Sc in engineering or sciences discipline. The degree should be of relevance to the opted M.Tech program. # Duration : 2 years # Study mode : Full time # Course level : PG # Course Fee : 1.88 lakhs # Approval : University Grants Commission # Details : Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) Circuit Design is the process of designing a large computer chip (more specifically$ an integrated circuit$ or IC)$ using computer-aided design (CAD) tools on a workstation or a personal computer (PC). The course demands learning the principles of VLSI design$ designing and fabricating the state- of-the-art VLSI chips$ understanding the complete design flow and expertise to design CMOS chips for industrial requirements. The curriculum focuses on employing hierarchical design methods and understanding the design issues at the various levels of hierarchy. Students are exposed to various design softwares in this programme. Also$ they learn to design$ simulate$ implement and test complex digital systems using FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays). The main objectives of this course are to analyze the electrical and design characteristics of transistors$ gates and to study the issues and methodologies involved in the integration of these devices into complex high-performance systems. >",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
